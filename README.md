# Explainable-Fake-News-Detection-on-ISOT-with-RoBERTa
Project focuses on detecting fake news using a transformer-based model, RoBERTa, trained on the ISOT dataset. The model classifies news articles as either real or fake with high accuracy. To enhance interpretability, the project integrates LIME, which provides human-understandable explanations for individual predictions made by the model.
